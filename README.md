Hey, 

Just decided to explore the lightHouse of the chrome dev tools and tried to understand the audits it goes through.
On seeing the results, I ended up seeing that it works well in the applications which are quite in small scale
But as the codebases and the functionality increases then we see that maintaining the performance is less ,I think the use of API's and the codebases optimization matters!

If you want to add why and how , please make sure to drop a mail, happy to learn!
